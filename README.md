# Implementation

The platform will have four types of users: admin, Mudugudu, Mutwarasibo, and Umuturage. The privileges of each user will depend on their role.

# Admin

The platform will be delivered as a Software as a Service (SaaS), meaning that the application will consume API functionalities from the backend.



# How it works

The platform allows village heads to manage and provide good services to citizens by creating events, notifying citizens of emergencies, tracking and recording citizens easily, and communicating with committees.
